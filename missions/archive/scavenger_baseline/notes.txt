Big Issue #1
=========================================================
o RECAP: the task behavior posts crucial info upon helm start, namely
  the alert requests to the task manager. If the task manager starts
  late than the helm, it will miss all alert requests beyond the last
  one posted. The hack for now is to launch the task manager earlier
  in the Antler block.

o The helm (BehaviorSet) should scan the behavior specs, or all
  behaviors during the startup spawn phase, for all Task behaviors and
  get the (task_type, update_var) pair.

o The helm should monitor DB_CLIENTS until it sees pTaskManager on the
  list, and then post all the TM_ALERT_REQUEST messages for the task
  manager.

o Ideally the name of the task manager app should be configureable,
  but default to pTaskManager, in case someone wants to build a
  different task manager later on.

Big Issue #2
========================================================
o RECAP: The helm, when reading the behavior file up on startup, will
  treat the '#' char as a comment delimiter. Not just on the beginning
  of the line, but in-line as well. This makes it impossible to have
  an updates posting as part of an endflag because they are of the
  form "name=henry # speed=2.3". Currently everything to the right of
  the '#' char is chopped off. The hack for now is to comment out this
  feature in the source code, Populator_BehaviorSet.cpp, around line
  226. This cannot be the fix however since it may break other
  people's missions.

o Possible fix 1: support escaped hashes like \# when reading the file

o Possible fix 2: support additional delimiters for updates, like '$',
  but this may break other people's mission files or updates posted
  from other apps

o Possile fix 3: Allow the helm to be optionally configured to ignore
  '#' as a comment delimeter

o Probably fix 1 is best


Big Issue #3
=========================================================
o RECAP: when a vehicle generates a mission task like "follow me",
  there is currently no easy way to convey the end of this task to the
  following vehicle.


Big Issue #4
=========================================================
o RECAP: The Leader behavior does not regulate its speed to maintain
  a desired position to the lead vehicle.
